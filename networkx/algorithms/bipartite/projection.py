    """Return the graph that is the projection of B onto the nodes.

    The nodes retain their names and are connected in the resulting
    graph if have an edge to a common node in the original graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    B : NetworkX graph 
      The input graph should be bipartite. 

    nodes : list or iterable
      Nodes to project onto (the "bottom" nodes).

    multigraph: bool (default=False)
       If True return a multigraph where the multiple edges represent multiple
       shared neighbors.  They edge key in the multigraph is assigned to the
       label of the neighbor.

    Returns
    -------
    Graph : NetworkX graph or multigraph
       A graph that is the projection onto the given nodes.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> B = nx.path_graph(4)
    >>> G = nx.projected_graph(B, [1,3]) 
    >>> print(G.nodes())
    [1, 3]
    >>> print(G.edges())
    [(1, 3)]
    
    If nodes 'a', and 'b' are connected through both nodes 1 and 2 then
    building a multigraph results in two edges in the projection onto
    ['a','b']:

    >>> B = nx.Graph()
    >>> B.add_edges_from([('a', 1), ('b', 1), ('a', 2), ('b', 2)])
    >>> G = nx.projected_graph(B, ['a', 'b'], multigraph=True)
    >>> print(G.edges(keys=True))
    [('a', 'b', 1), ('a', 'b', 2)]

    Notes
    ------
    No attempt is made to verify that the input graph B is bipartite.
    Returns a simple graph that is the projection of the bipartite graph B
    onto the set of nodes given in list nodes.  If multigraph=True then
    a multigraph is returned with an edge for every shared neighbor.

    Directed graphs are allowed as input.  The output will also then
    be a directed graph with edges if there is a directed path between
    the nodes.

    The graph and node properties are (shallow) copied to the projected graph.
